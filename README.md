Streamlit App => ([https://onlineretail-data-visualization.streamlit.app/])

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project transforms over 500,000 raw transaction records from a UK-based online retailer into an interactive **Strategic Dashboard**. 

Unlike typical dashboards that only show "what happened," this project focuses on **"why it happened"** and **"what to do next"** using advanced analytics techniques like **RFM Segmentation** and **Pareto Analysis**.

## 💡 Key Business Insights
The analysis is divided into 3 phases:
- **Phase 1: Business Overview** (Sales Trends, Top Products, Global Markets)
- **Phase 2: Operational Efficiency** (Hourly Sales Patterns, Return Rate Analysis)
- **Phase 3: Strategic Customer Analysis** (The Highlight 💎)
  - **RFM Segmentation:** Identifying VIPs vs. Churned customers.
  - **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule):** Validating that 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% of customers.
  - **Retention Analysis:** Tracking monthly active users.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Data Processing)
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering)
- **Plotly Express** (Interactive Visualizations)
- **Streamlit** (Web Application Deployment)

## 📂 Dataset
Used the **Online Retail II** dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository), containing transactions between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.
